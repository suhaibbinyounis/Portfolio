        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello.</p><p>As a computer programmer for several years, I’ve spent a lot of time presenting interesting stories through ideas and creative thinking. I keep myself occupied with numerous initiatives that I find useful.</p><p>I’m currently working as a software developer at Bank of America, where I develop and maintain web applications and software solutions for various business needs. I have a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.srmist.edu.in/," title="SRMIST">SRM Institute of Science and Technology</a>.</p><p>I’m also a self-proclaimed scientist who likes to explore various domains of computer science, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, data mining, web development, and more. I have published a research paper on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6lmurQAAAAJ," title="Google Scholar">“Opinion mining on web-based communities using optimised clustering algorithms”</a> in the Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education (TURCOMAT), which has been cited by 6+ other papers.</p><p>I enjoy writing blogs about various topics that fascinate me, such as reality, friendship, magic, and thoughts. You can check out my blog at <a href="https://suhaib.in,/" title="Personal Blog">suhaib.in</a>, where I share my thoughts and opinions on various issues and ideas. Some of my blogs posted are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://suhaib.in/2023/02/25/What-is-reality/," title="What is Reality">What Is Reality?</a>: A philosophical exploration of the nature of reality and how we perceive it.</li><li><a href="https://suhaib.in/2022/12/31/Friendships-endure-over-distance-and-time/," title="Friendships Endure Over Distance and Time">Friendships Endure Over Distance and Time</a>: A personal reflection on how friendships can last despite physical separation and time differences.</li><li><a href="https://suhaib.in/2022/12/31/Dark-Clouds/," title="Dark Clouds">Dark Clouds</a>: A poetic expression of the feelings of sadness and loneliness that sometimes overwhelm us.</li><li><a href="https://suhaib.in/2022/12/19/Magic-behind-magic/," title="Magic Behind Magic">Magic Behind Magic</a>: A scientific analysis of the phenomenon of magic and how it works in the real world.</li><li><a href="https://suhaib.in/2022/12/16/Thoughts-101/," title="Thoughts 101">Thoughts 101</a>: A collection of random thoughts and musings that I have from time to time.</li></ul><p>I believe that once we die we are not coming back. So I try to do all the stuff that I ever wanted to do. It doesn’t really matter if I’m losing out on something I don’t care about. Life is a do-it-yourself project and it takes half your life to discover the fact.</p><p>Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me if you share my interests and would like to collaborate. </p><p>Thanks &amp; Regards,<br>Suhaib Bin Younis</p>]]></content>
